## Tarpit Web API

### What is it? 

Tarpit is a web API for Deno modeled after ASP.NET / Spring Boot

### Why does this exist?

1. Because I thought it would be fun to make
2. While other MVC/web API libraries and frameworks provide a variety of features, many of which I find to be useful/desirable on their own, I've often found that there's one or two almost deal-breaking features that make me wish I was using a different one. In short, Tarpit is basically my wishlist come to life for a web API.
